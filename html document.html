      <h4><p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It is a standardized system for tagging text files to achieve font, color, graphic, and hyperlink effects on World Wide Web pages. HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text, images, and other material into visible or audible web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.</p></h4>

      <h3>What is a Hr tag in html?</h3>
        <H4>  
          <br>The hr tag in HTML element represents a thematic break between paragraph-level elements, for example a change of scene in a story, or a shift of topic within a section.
          <br>Historically, the above has been presented as a horizontal rule or line.<br> While it may still be displayed as a horizontal rule in visual browsers, this element is now defined in semantic terms, rather than presentational terms, so if you wish to draw a horizontal line, you should do so using appropriate CSS.
